# Dodge the Creeps!

Written in godot; simple game to avoid randomly moving "creeps" on the screen.
Demonstrates user control, scene creation, spawning mobs, collision, sound, etc.
_Not original work; I did not create this._

Implemented in GDScript. Its similiar to python; I liked that.

## Notes

Learning godot.  The tutorial is straightforward. (It can be done in an afternoon.)

### filetypes

* *.tscn - scenes, an INI like text file.  You should use the IDE to manage these. 
* *.gd - scripts, text files. This is the program code for the project. 
* project.godot - as INI like text file. Stores project wide configuration. Of note, your input map is here. You should use the IDE to manage it.
